\section{Variants}
\label{sec:variants}
In the first few years following the introduction of the L* algorithm in
\cite{Angluin87}, it was only a theoretical exploration of active learning.
The various improvements described in the previous chapter,
such as \TODO{Cite some important improvements here},
made practical applications suddenly more feasible.

In applying L* or improvements thereof to practical applications,
there were still some practical limitations and restrictions that had to
be addressed.
In order to do so several variants with restrictions have been proposed,
such as: \TODO{Cite learnlib or upstream document, is bookmarked}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Interacting with real systems instead of regular languages.
  \item Membership queries, order of magnitude.
  \item Systems without a reset.
  \item Learning without equivalence queries.
\end{itemize}
