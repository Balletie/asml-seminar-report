\section{Variants}
\label{sec:variants}
In the first few years following the introduction of the L* algorithm by
D. Angluin~\cite{Angluin87}, L* learning was only a theoretical exploration.
The various improvements described in the previous chapter,
such as \textit{Classification Trees} \cref{sec:classification-trees} and
the \textit{TTT} algorithm \cref{sec:ttt}
made practical applications already more feasible.

In applying L* or improvements thereof to practical applications,
there were still some practical limitations and restrictions that had to
be addressed (Steffen 2011, Ch. 6~\cite{Steffen11}).
Some of these issues can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Equivalence queries are generally undecidable for black boxes
  \item L* can only interact with regular languages, not with real systems
  \item The amount of required membership queries can grow very fast
  \item Membership queries might not be independent in practice,
        which imposes the requirement for a \textit{reset} function
  \item Not all systems might support a \textit{reset} function.
\end{itemize}

In order to address these limitations and restrictions,
several variants of the L* algorithm have been proposed,
each with the goal to solve such an issue.
In this chapter we will further elaborate on some of these issues
and the variants proposed to solve them.

\subsection{Approximating \textit{EQUIV (M)} queries with \textit{MEMBER (w)} queries}
The target machine on which the learning algorithm is applied is generally
a black box, since we want to infer knowledge about some unknown system.
Therefore equivalence queries can only be answered by exhaustively testing
the inputs of the system. This problem has been shown to be undecidably hard.

In order to solve this issue model-based testing techniques have been used,
such as \textit{Chow's W-method} or the \textit{WP-method} \todo{Cite here}.
These methods rely on approximating \textit{EQUIV (M)} queries by using
\textit{MEMBER (w)} queries.

To further research in this area,
the \textit{ZULU} challenge~\cite{Combe10} was introduced.
The \textit{ZULU} challenge asked participants to find a DFA corresponding
to a certain system as accurately as possible, while imposing a restriction
on the number of \textit{MEMBER (w)} queries and disallowing \textit{EQUIV (M)}
queries completely.
\todo{Elaborate on ZULU some more}

\subsection{Limiting the amount of membership queries}
In a theoretical framework the learning algorithm doesn't have to account
for execution times of individual \textit{MEMBER (w)} queries.
In practice, such queries might take time or be expensive to execute.
Therefore algorithms benefit from reducing the amount of queries needed.
Some generic improvements in this regard have already been covered in
\todo{Reference previous chapter}.

However, when using for example \textit{Chow's method} for \textit{EQUIV (M)}
queries, the amount of membership queries needed grows exponentially
in the number of states \todo{Cite source for exponential complexity of Chow's}.

\todo{Cite ZULU participant here, since the challenge also imposed
      a maximum on \textit{MEMBER (w)} queries}
