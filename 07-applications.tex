\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

This chapter serves to highlight some interesting and important practical
applications of active state machine learning. The goal is not to discuss
individual applications, rather several ``domains'' of application have been
identified: protocol verification, software testing and  botnet identification.
Each domain will be introduced shortly and illustrated with a short example.

\subsection{Protocol Verification}
One commonly used application of active state machine learning is
protocol verification. This checks whether a protocol implementation follows
its formal description. This description is used to identify states and
allowed transitions. These transitions are then used to find out whether the
implementation's logic is according to the specification. The input alphabet
is defined as an abstract set of messages that relate to the messages the
protocol specification defines. Furthermore, an output alphabet is defined,
containing a set of abstractions of the possible messages the protocol can
output. Often, the output alphabet is concatenated with some special states,
like a reset state. Later on in this section, an example of such an extension
is given.

Sequences of input messages are then constructed and passed as to the
verification machine. If the machine's output matches the expected output, the
logic of the implementation is correct. However, if the expected output does
not match the actual output, there is some bug in the implementation of the
protocol that is being tested. The tests are performed as black box testing,
resulting in the need for approximation as explained in \cref{sec:variants}.
One specific example of protocol verification is given below. More examples of
applications can be found in~\cite{Aarts2013,Cho2010,Aarts2010}.

\subsubsection{TLS-protocol Verification} For this specific protocol verification
application~\cite{deRuiter2015}, an improved version of the W-method as explained
in \cref{sec:chow} is used. The improvement comes forth from the fact that the
TLS-protocol requires the output to be ``Connection closed'' at all times, once
a connection is closed. By making use of this and thus limiting the W-method to
halt whenever the connection is closed, a great reduction in the time needed to
perform the implementation analysis is achieved. Furthermore, especially since
the W-method is a very costly one, interrupting the trace generation as soon as
the connection has been closed reduces the number of membership queries
significantly. An aspect that has proven to be difficult in practice, namely
that of resetting the state of the machine after each iteration, is for this
specific application fairly easy. De Ruiter et al. defined an additional
message, a ``reset''-message. This, when output, sets up a new client-server
connection, after which a new iteration can start.
