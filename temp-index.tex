\section{W-method for Hierarchical and Communicating Finite State Machines}
This document is about using the W-method to test finite state machines.
It briefly describes the W-method.
It also describes FSM in general.
The W-method is both applied to a general FSM and to a network of communicating FSM.

\section{Testing Software Design Modeled by Finite-State Machines}
This document is often cited as basis for the W-method.
Written by the author of the method, this article describes proof for "the method".
This document does not refer to the W-method at all, it simply describes something known as "the method".


\section{Failure diagnosis of automata}
This document largely consists of proof of the bounds of the W-method.
