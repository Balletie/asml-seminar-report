In the late 80s, research about active state machine learning became popular
amongst computer scientists. Possibilitities for real applications at that
time were very limited, due to the novelty of the topic and lack of computer
processing power.
Nowadays, where computers have emerged to be very powerful and many improvements
to the fundamentals have been proposed, applying the theory founded decades ago
has become realistic. To do such innovation, a thorough understanding of the
research done since the very first paper on the topic is required.
This article aims to provide the reader with a clear and comprehensive overview
of the evolution of active state machine learning, from fundamental theory and
subsequent improvements to real-world applications.
