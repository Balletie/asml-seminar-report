In the late 80's, research about active state machine learning became immensely
popular amongst computer scientists. Possibilitities for real applications at
that time were very limited, mostly due to computer hardware constraints.
Nowadays, where computers have emerged to be very powerful, applying the theory
founded decades ago has become realistic. To do such innovation, a thorough
understanding of the research done since the very first paper on the topic is
required. This document aims to provide the reader with a clear and
comprehensive overview of the evolution of active state machine learning,
chronologically ordered wherever possible.
