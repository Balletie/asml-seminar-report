\section{Improvements}
\label{sec:improvements}
There are several improvements to be made with respect to the algorithms
described in \cref{sec:variants,sec:fundamental-theory}, using different data
structures which decrease the space complexity.

\subsection{Classification Trees}
\label{sec:classification-trees}
Introduced by Kearns and Vazirani\cite{Kearns94}, classification trees (or
\textit{discrimination trees}) were meant as a replacement for the observation
table (see \cref{sec:data-structure}). In other words, it is a different data
structure for storing the sets $S$ and $E$ of access strings and distinguishing
extensions. The main characteristic of a classification tree is that it is
\textit{redundancy-free}, which will be explained in this section.

Say that we have a classification tree for some target automaton $M$. The labels
of the internal nodes of the tree are distinguishing extensions from the set
$E$, and the labels of leaf nodes are access strings from $S$. The tree's
structure is such that for any internal node $e \in E$, its left subtree
contains all $s \in S$ such that $s \concat e$ is rejected by $M$, and its right subtree
contains those $s$ such that $s \concat e$ is accepted by $M$.

From the way the tree is constructed, any pair of access strings $v,w \in S$ are
distinguished by their \textit{lowest common ancestor} in the tree. Thus, $v$
and $w$ are distinguished by exactly \textit{one} distinguishing
extension. Furthermore, it follows from the Myhill-Nerode
Theorem~\todo{reference subsection chpt 2} that the strings $v$ and $w$ are
Nirode-inequivalent, and thus each string represents a distinct equivalence
class\todo{``candidate-state''?}. Howar~et~al. note that from this it follows
that a discrimination tree is \textit{redundancy-free}, as opposed to
observation tables where states can be distinguished by multiple distinguishing
extensions\todo{Verify this. What do Howar et al mean with ``fixed number of
  discriminators''?}\cite{Howar14}.
