\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

As the previous chapters have shown, active state machine learning is a
well studied theoretical learning technology. Since 19xx (TODO: find source)
active state machine learning has been applicable in the real world due to
advancements made in both the algorithms and computer hardware.\todo{find
reference}

This chapter serves to highlight some interesting and important practical
applications of active state machine learning. The goal is not to discuss
individual applications, rather several ``domains'' of application have been
identified. Before doing so, however, the bridge between theory and application
must be crossed.

\subsection{From theory to practice}
\label{sec:theory-to-practice}

The learning algorithms discussed in the previous chapter all required an
(abstract, formal) input alphabet, an (abstract, formal) output alphabet,
membership queries and equivalence queries. In practice, it is in many cases
quite difficult to realize these requirements for a specific system under
learning. This section discusses these challenges faced when applying active
state machine learning to real world scenarios.

\paragraph{Interaction with real world applications} Before active state machine
learning can be used in practice, a mapping has to be made from an abstract,
formal input alphabet to a concrete real world ``language'' understood by
reactive systems (it is evident that reactive systems are a requirement for
practical active state machine learning)\todo{begrippenlijst aanmaken met
definities?}. This mapping needs to result in a deterministic language for it to
work\cite{Steffen11a}. In the same way, the output of the system under learning
needs to be mapped back to an abstract language understood by the
tool.\todo{refer to arjan's piece}

Whilst such a mapping has different peculiarities per application, there is an
overlapping theme that applies to every mapping: it needs to be abstract enough
in terms of communication (leading to a useful model structure, see below) while
allowing for an automatic back and forth translation between the abstract and
the concrete languages. An interesting fact is that it turns out that the active
state machine learning algorithm can be enhanced per specific application using
application-specific optimizations. For more information on recent work focusing
on these abstractions, see \cite{Aarts10,Howar11,Jonsson11}.

Besides mapping input- and output alphabets, the gap between the abstract learned model
and the concrete application also has to be bridged: when an abstract learned
model is presented to the user, it has to be ``translated'' to a representation
of the system under learning. This is rather simple for those applications that
are designed explicitly for connectivity (such as web services or communication
protocols), because these are made to be invoked from the outside. For other
types of applications, this can be arbitrarily difficult.

A second last obstacle to overcome is that of parameters used in real world
applications. Think, for example, about increasing sequence numbers in
communication protocols or authentication. This is still a huge challenge to
resolve and for now, besides the creation of prototypical solutions,
application-specific solutions have to be applied.\cite{Steffen11a}.

The final hurdle is that of a ``reset''. Membership queries have to be
independent. In practice this often means that applications have to be reset in
between successive membership queries.

\paragraph{Membership queries}
Membership queries are the most straightforward to translate to real world
applications: they can be realized via testing. %TODO: expand

% TODO: discuss B: membership queries page 34 of STEFFEN-Handout-Learning2?

\paragraph{Equivalence queries} In theoretical simulations, equivalence testing
is often easy because often the target system is known. In practice, however,
the system under test is usually a black box system. This means that equivalence
queries will have to be approximated, typically using membership queries. These
approximated membership queries are in general not decidable without assuming
any extra knowledge, such as the number of states of the system under
learning: it is impossible to be certain that the system has been tested
extensively\cite{Steffen11a} enough.

If more information about the system under learning is known, model-based
testing methods can be used. If, for example, an upper bound on the number of
states of the system under learning is known, the
W-method\cite{Chow78}\todo{refer to previous chapters} or the
Wp-method\cite{Fujiwara91}\todo{add more examples?} can be used.

\todo{Discuss first paragraph of page 33 in \cite{Steffen11a}?}

All the above problems might give the impression that active state machine
learning is not yet applicable to real world applications. While it is true that
practical application is not yet complete, great progress has been made and
great things have already been achieved. The next few highlights of real world
applications serve to illustrate this fact.
