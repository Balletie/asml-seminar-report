\section{\cite{Angluin87} Learning Regular Sets from Queries and Counterexamples}
Original paper by Dana Angluin.
Describes the $L^*$ algorithm for learning DFA's from regular sets.
Drawbacks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item applicable only to regular languages
  \item not very efficient, various improvements have been developed
  \item not very readable
  \item clearer and more modern summary

        \href{https://www.cs.bgu.ac.il/~beimel/Courses/Learning/lect3.ps}{here}.
\end{itemize}

\section{\cite{Howar14} Tutorial: Automata Learning in Practice}
Lists and summarizes improvements that can be made to the $L^*$ learning algorithm.
Primarily focuses on removing sources of redundancy in membership queries.
\begin{itemize}
  \item TTT \cite{Isberner14b}, based on discrimination trees\cite{Kearns94}
  \item Observation pack algorithm
\end{itemize}

\section{\cite{deRuiter15} Protocol State Fuzzing of TLS Implementations}
Details learning a \textit{state machine model} for a given TLS implementation.
Knowledge gap between \cite{Angluin87} and this paper is quite large.
Required knowledge:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \cite{Angluin87} Basics of $L^*$ automata learning.
  \item \cite{Steffen12} Mapping input / output to DFAs.
\end{itemize}

\section{An Abstract Framework for Counterexample Analysis in Active Automata Learning\cite{Isberner14a}}
Presents a way for reducing counterexample analysis strategies to one common
framework. They also apply the framework to the Kearns and Vazarani's
discrimination tree algorithm\cite{Kearns94}. In so doing they also compare that
algorithm to the Observation Pack algorithm, which also uses a discrimination
tree but combines it with Rivest \& Schapire's counter example
analysis\cite{Rivest93}.
