  abstract      = {The "automata theoretic" method of testing software has
                  the following characteristics: 1. Only the control
                  structure of the design is checked. 2. It does not require
                  an "executable" specification. 3. Test sequences are
                  guaranteed to reveal any errors in the control structure,
                  provided that some reasonable assumptions are satisfied.
                  The method used is composed of 3 steps which are: 1.
                  estimating the maximum number of states in the correct
                  design, 2. generating test sequences based on the design,
                  3. verifying the responses to the test sequences generated
                  in the previous step. The method has already been
                  successfully implemented in 3 test cases: computer
                  graphics, real-time process control, and telephone
                  switching. The method is still under study, but plans
                  already exist for the automating of the test sequence
                  generation. Figures.},
