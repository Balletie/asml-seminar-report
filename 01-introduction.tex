\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Active state machine learning is a framework in which a learning algorithm (the
Learner) is given access to a Teacher to ask different kinds of questions. The
goal of active state machine learning is to identify an unknown state machine.
It was first introduced by Dana Angluin in her paper \textit{Learning Regular
  Sets from Queries and Counterexamples} in 1987~\cite{Angluin1987}.

Active state machine learning tools are becoming increasingly prevalent in
today's world for many different applications. Examples of such applications are
protocol implementation validation and detection of botnets.

There are a plethora of papers and articles written about active state machine
learning. Many, however, use different terms, slight variations on algorithms
or data structures or are otherwise difficult to read. This leads to the
situation in which it is hard to get a proper overview of the subject.

The goal of this article, therefore, is to give a global overview of where the
technology of active state machine learning is currently at. While doing so, an
attempt is made to bring together all different terms used and to explain the
slight variations in algorithms. For this reason, this article should serve the
purpose of giving the reader a quick, concise but complete overview of not only
the current state of the art, but also the history of active state machine
learning and important advances made within this field of study over time.

To accomplish this, \cref{sec:fundamental-theory} explains the fundamental
theory behind the $L^{*}$ algorithm for learning regular
sets. \Cref{sec:improvements} discusses improvements to the $L^{*}$
algorithm. \Cref{sec:variants} discusses the problems that arise when applying
the $L^{*}$ algorithm to real life problem domain(s) and the variatons on the
original algorithm that solve these problems.

The remaining sections are concerned with applications of active state machine
learning. \Cref{sec:tools} discusses several tools that have been created to
apply active state machine learning. Lastly, important real world applications
are highlighted in \cref{sec:applications}.
